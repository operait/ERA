## LLM Prompt Template

```
Analyze if this HR guidance recommends that the manager should send an email or written documentation to the employee.

Response: "{response}"

Consider as TRIGGERS:
- Direct recommendations: "send an email", "email them", "draft a message"
- Documentation: "follow up in writing", "send written notice", "document via email"
- Templates offered: "here's an email template", "want me to draft"
- Next steps: "then email them", "follow up with email", "send them an email"
- Written communication: "put it in writing", "written documentation"

DO NOT trigger for:
- Receiving emails: "wait for their email response"
- Email as contact: "their email is john@company.com"
- Past tense: "you already emailed them"
- Email mentions only: "email is one way to reach them"
- Questions: "have you sent an email?"
- Negatives: "don't email them yet"

Answer in JSON:
{
  "should_trigger_email": true/false,
  "confidence": "high/medium/low",
  "reasoning": "brief explanation in one sentence"
}
```

## Edge Cases & Ambiguity

### Ambiguous Case 1: Multiple Communication Methods

**Example:** "Call them first, and if no answer, send an email."

**Analysis:**
- Contains both call and email recommendations
- Email is conditional on call failing
- Both actions are recommended

**Decision:** ‚úÖ TRUE for BOTH calendar AND email
(Both intents detected, both workflows triggered)

### Ambiguous Case 2: Email Mentions in Context

**Example:** "When documenting this incident, include details like date, time, and email correspondence."

**Analysis:**
- "email correspondence" is mentioned
- But not recommending to send an email
- Just referring to emails as data to include

**Decision:** ‚ùå FALSE (mention only, not recommendation)

### Ambiguous Case 3: Written vs Email

**Example:** "Send them written documentation of the policy violation."

**Analysis:**
- "Written documentation" could mean email or physical letter
- In modern context, usually means email
- Best interpreted as email recommendation

**Decision:** ‚úÖ TRUE (written documentation typically means email)

### Ambiguous Case 4: Template Without Send Instruction

**Example:** "Here's a template you can use if you decide to reach out in writing."

**Analysis:**
- Template provided
- But conditional "if you decide"
- Not a direct recommendation

**Decision:** üü° MEDIUM confidence ‚Üí Lean toward ‚úÖ TRUE
(Template provision typically implies recommendation to use it)

## Integration with Context-Aware Detection

Email intent detection runs AFTER context-aware blocking logic:

```typescript
// Step 1: Context-aware blocking (from specs/CONTEXT_AWARE_ACTIONS.md)
if (conversationState?.type === 'email') {
  return false; // Already in email flow
}

if (this.containsClarifyingQuestions(response)) {
  return false; // ERA is still gathering info
}

if (conversationHistory.length < 2) {
  return false; // Need minimum conversation depth
}

if (!this.isContextGathered(conversationHistory)) {
  return false; // Manager hasn't answered ERA's questions yet
}

// Step 2: Intent detection (this spec)
const emailIntent = await intentDetector.detectEmailIntent(response);
return emailIntent.should_trigger;
```

This ensures email workflow only triggers when:
1. Not already in email flow
2. ERA isn't asking clarifying questions
3. Enough conversation context exists
4. Manager has answered ERA's questions
5. **AND** ERA's response recommends emailing

## Email Templates and Variable Extraction

When email intent is detected, the system also extracts:

1. **Template Type**: Warning letter, follow-up, policy reminder, etc.
2. **Required Variables**: Employee name, dates, policy references
3. **Tone**: Formal, conversational, urgent
4. **Subject Line**: Derived from context

Example:
```typescript
{
  should_trigger_email: true,
  confidence: 'high',
  reasoning: 'Recommends sending written warning',
  template_type: 'disciplinary_warning',
  suggested_subject: 'Attendance Discussion Follow-Up',
  required_vars: ['employee_name', 'dates', 'policy_section']
}
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Precision** | >95% | (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Positives) |
| **Recall** | >98% | (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Negatives) |
| **F1 Score** | >96% | Harmonic mean of precision and recall |
| **LLM Response Time** | <200ms p95 | Time from request to response |
| **Agreement with Keywords** | >75% | Both methods agree (lower than calendar due to "written" ambiguity) |

### Success Criteria

- Zero false positives in first 100 production uses
- <3% false negatives in first 100 production uses
- >90% agreement with manual human review
- No user complaints about email triggered incorrectly

---

## Parallel Detection with Calendar

Both calendar and email detection run in parallel to minimize latency:

```typescript
const [calendarIntent, emailIntent] = await Promise.all([
  intentDetector.detectCalendarIntent(response, history),
  intentDetector.detectEmailIntent(response, history)
]);

// Both can trigger if response recommends both actions
if (calendarIntent.should_trigger) {
  // Start calendar flow
}

if (emailIntent.should_trigger) {
  // Start email flow
}
```

**Example triggering both:**
```
ERA: "Call them to discuss, then follow up with a written email summarizing your conversation."

Result:
- Calendar: ‚úÖ TRUE (recommends calling)
- Email: ‚úÖ TRUE (recommends email follow-up)
- Action: Both workflows offered in sequence
```

---

## Prompt Tuning Guidelines

If accuracy issues arise, tune the LLM prompt by:

1. **Clarify "written" ambiguity** - Does it always mean email?
2. **Add examples for template offers** - When is offering a template enough?
3. **Handle multi-method scenarios** - "Call or email them"
4. **Address conditional recommendations** - "If needed, send an email"

### Prompt Versioning

Track prompt changes over time:
- **v1.0**: Initial prompt (this spec)
- **v1.1**: Clarify "written documentation" = email (if needed)
- **v1.2**: Add guidance for template-only responses (if needed)

## Appendix: Full Keyword List (Fallback)

Current keyword list maintained for fallback only:

```typescript
const emailKeywords = [
  'send an email',
  'send them an email',
  'email them',
  'email the employee',
  'draft an email',
  'draft a message',
  'follow up in writing',
  'send written notice',
  'written documentation',
  'document via email',
  'put it in writing',
  'send a written',
  'here\'s an email template',
  'want me to draft',
  'i can help you write',
  'would you like me to draft',
  'follow up with an email',
  'then email them',
  'send an email summary',
  'email after the call',
  'shoot them an email',
  'send them written',
  'email documenting',
  'email to confirm',
  'email outlining',
];
```

**Note:** This list will remain in code as emergency fallback but will not be expanded. LLM should handle all new phrasings naturally, especially ambiguous "written" references.
