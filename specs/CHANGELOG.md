# Specification Changelog

## 2025-10-24 - Updates Based on Feedback

### Changes Made

#### 1. Test Harness - Real Graph API Integration

**Issue:** Specs showed mock mode as primary, but Barry wants to test with REAL email/calendar integration.

**Changes:**
- Updated [TEST_HARNESS.md](./TEST_HARNESS.md) to make **real Graph API integration the primary mode**
- Email testing now **sends real emails** via Microsoft Graph API
- Calendar testing now **books real events** and checks **real availability** from Outlook
- Mock mode is now **optional** (use `--mock` flag for quick iteration)
- Updated all example outputs to show successful real integration

**Before:**
```
⚠️ Graph API credentials not configured
Saving to file instead...
```

**After:**
```
✅ Email sent successfully!
   Message ID: AAMkAGVm...

✅ Event booked successfully!
   Event ID: AAMkADU3...
   View in Outlook: https://outlook.office.com/calendar/...
```

#### 2. Prompt Optimizer - GitHub PR Creation

**Issue:** Script was creating PRs programmatically, but Claude Web Code should handle PR creation using its native GitHub integration.

**Changes:**
- Updated [PROMPT_OPTIMIZER.md](./PROMPT_OPTIMIZER.md) to have **Claude Web Code create the PR**
- Script now only generates the updated MASTER_PROMPT.md file
- Claude Web Code uses its built-in GitHub integration to create the PR
- Removed `createPullRequest()` method from the script
- Updated workflow documentation

**Before:**
```typescript
// Script creates PR
const prUrl = await this.createPullRequest(updatedPrompt, summary, patterns);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Script only generates updated prompt
// Claude Web Code creates PR using native integration
fs.writeFileSync('MASTER_PROMPT.md', updatedPrompt);
```

#### 3. Prompt Optimizer - Slash Command UX

**Issue:** Meg had to type full sentences like "I have a CSV from my ERA testing session. Can you optimize the master prompt?"

**Changes:**
- Created **`/optimize` slash command** in [.claude/commands/optimize.md](./../.claude/commands/optimize.md)
- Meg can now simply type `/optimize` and paste CSV
- Much cleaner, faster UX
- Command file includes instructions for Claude Web Code

**Before:**
```
Meg: I have a CSV from my ERA testing session. Can you optimize the master prompt?
[pastes CSV]
```

**After:**
```
Meg: /optimize
[pastes CSV]
```

### Summary

All three pieces of feedback have been addressed:

✅ **Test harness uses real Graph API** (primary mode) for email and calendar testing
✅ **Claude Web Code creates PRs** (not the script) using native GitHub integration
✅ **`/optimize` slash command** provides simple, clean UX for Meg

The specs now reflect a better workflow:
- Barry can fully test email/calendar features locally with real Outlook integration
- Meg gets a streamlined UX with the `/optimize` command
- PR creation leverages Claude Web Code's built-in capabilities instead of custom code
