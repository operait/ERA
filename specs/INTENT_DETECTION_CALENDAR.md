# Calendar Intent Detection Specification

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Related:** [Intent Detection System](./INTENT_DETECTION.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-27

---

## Purpose

Detect when ERA's HR guidance recommends that a manager should call or directly contact an employee, triggering the automated calendar booking flow.

---

## Detection Criteria

### SHOULD Trigger Calendar Booking

**1. Direct Call Recommendations**
- "Call them to discuss..."
- "You should call your employee..."
- "Give them a call..."
- "Phone them to check in..."
- "Call the employee directly..."

**2. Contact/Reach Out Recommendations**
- "Reach out to them..."
- "Contact your employee..."
- "Get in touch with them..."
- "Try to reach them..."
- "Make contact with the employee..."

**3. Next Step Guidance**
- "The next step is to call..."
- "First, call them..."
- "Start by calling the employee..."
- "Your first action should be to call..."

**4. Conditional Call Recommendations**
- "If they don't respond, call them..."
- "After documenting, call to follow up..."
- "Once you have the details, call them..."

**5. Phone-Specific Guidance**
- "Give them a phone call..."
- "Try reaching by phone..."
- "Contact them by phone..."

### Should NOT Trigger Calendar Booking

**1. Employee Calling Manager (Reverse Direction)**
- ‚ùå "Wait for them to call you back"
- ‚ùå "They should call you"
- ‚ùå "Ask them to give you a call"
- ‚ùå "See if they reach out"

**2. Past Tense (Already Done)**
- ‚ùå "You called them yesterday"
- ‚ùå "After you called..."
- ‚ùå "Since you already reached out..."
- ‚ùå "Following your call..."

**3. Hypothetical Scenarios (Not Recommendations)**
- ‚ùå "If you call them, make sure to..."
- ‚ùå "When you call, remember to..."
- ‚ùå "Calling might be helpful, but..."

**4. Questions About Calling (Not Instructions)**
- ‚ùå "Have you tried calling them?"
- ‚ùå "Did you call the employee?"
- ‚ùå "Have you reached out yet?"

**5. Negative/Conditional Don'ts**
- ‚ùå "Don't call them yet"
- ‚ùå "Wait before calling"
- ‚ùå "Avoid calling until..."

**6. Just Mentioning Calls (No Recommendation)**
- ‚ùå "Employees often call in sick..."
- ‚ùå "No call/no show policy states..."
- ‚ùå "Phone numbers should be updated..."

## LLM Prompt Template

```
Analyze if this HR guidance recommends that the manager should call or contact the employee directly.

Response: "{response}"

Consider as TRIGGERS:
- Direct recommendations: "call them", "reach out to them", "contact the employee"
- Indirect suggestions: "try contacting", "get in touch", "give them a call"
- Next steps: "the next step is to call", "you should call"
- Action guidance: "reach out by phone", "schedule a call"

DO NOT trigger for:
- Employee calling IN: "wait for them to call you back"
- Past tense: "you called them yesterday"
- Hypotheticals: "if you call them" (without recommendation)
- Negative: "don't call them yet"
- Questions about calling: "have you tried calling?"

Answer in JSON:
{
  "should_trigger_calendar": true/false,
  "confidence": "high/medium/low",
  "reasoning": "brief explanation in one sentence"
}
```

## Edge Cases & Ambiguity

### Ambiguous Case 1: Conditional Hypotheticals

**Example:** "If you decide to call them, make sure to document it."

**Analysis:**
- Contains "call them" but framed as hypothetical
- No direct recommendation to call
- Just guidance on what to do IF calling

**Decision:** ‚ùå FALSE (not a recommendation)

### Ambiguous Case 2: Multi-Step with Call Included

**Example:** "Document the incident, call the employee, and email HR."

**Analysis:**
- Multiple actions listed
- "Call" is one of the steps
- Part of a sequence of instructions

**Decision:** ‚úÖ TRUE (call is recommended as part of action plan)

### Ambiguous Case 3: Indirect "Should"

**Example:** "You should try to reach them somehow."

**Analysis:**
- "Reach them" is contact-related
- But "somehow" is vague - could mean any method
- Not phone-specific

**Decision:** üü° MEDIUM confidence ‚Üí Lean toward ‚úÖ TRUE
(LLM can interpret "reach them" as call-worthy)

## Integration with Context-Aware Detection

Calendar intent detection runs AFTER context-aware blocking logic:

```typescript
// Step 1: Context-aware blocking (from specs/CONTEXT_AWARE_ACTIONS.md)
if (conversationState?.type === 'calendar') {
  return false; // Already in calendar flow
}

if (this.containsClarifyingQuestions(response)) {
  return false; // ERA is still gathering info
}

if (conversationHistory.length < 2) {
  return false; // Need minimum conversation depth
}

if (!this.isContextGathered(conversationHistory)) {
  return false; // Manager hasn't answered ERA's questions yet
}

// Step 2: Intent detection (this spec)
const calendarIntent = await intentDetector.detectCalendarIntent(response);
return calendarIntent.should_trigger;
```

This ensures calendar booking only triggers when:
1. Not already in calendar flow
2. ERA isn't asking clarifying questions
3. Enough conversation context exists
4. Manager has answered ERA's questions
5. **AND** ERA's response recommends calling

## Prompt Tuning Guidelines

If accuracy issues arise, tune the LLM prompt by:

1. **Add more examples** in the prompt for edge cases
2. **Clarify ambiguous phrases** (e.g., "reach out somehow")
3. **Add explicit negative examples** that were triggering incorrectly
4. **Adjust confidence thresholds** (e.g., only trigger on HIGH confidence)

### Prompt Versioning

Track prompt changes over time:
- **v1.0**: Initial prompt (this spec)
- **v1.1**: Add clarification for hypotheticals (if needed)
- **v1.2**: Add examples for multi-step sequences (if needed)

## Appendix: Full Keyword List (Fallback)

Current keyword list maintained for fallback only:

```typescript
const calendarKeywords = [
  'schedule a call',
  'schedule that call',
  'schedule the call',
  'call the employee',
  'call your employee',
  'call them',
  'phone call',
  'schedule a meeting',
  'set up a call',
  'arrange a call',
  'would you like me to schedule',
  'i can schedule',
  'check your calendar',
  'find available times',
  'you should call',
  'you need to call',
  'make a second call',
  'schedule that',
  'reach out to them',
  'reach out to your employee',
  'contact them',
  'contact your employee',
  'give them a call',
  'try calling',
  'next step is to call',
  'reach them',
  'get in touch with them',
];
```

**Note:** This list will remain in code as emergency fallback but will not be expanded. LLM should handle all new phrasings naturally.
