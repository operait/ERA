      "Bash(the call?\" even though it just booked it.\n\nROOT CAUSE:\nThe calendar handler was calling clearState() immediately after booking,\ncompletely erasing all booking details from memory.\n\nTHE FIX:\n1. Added ''completed'' step to CalendarConversationState\n2. Added bookedTime field to store formatted time\n3. Instead of clearing state after booking, mark as ''completed''\n4. Updated handleCalendarStep to not intercept when step=''completed''\n5. Inject calendar context into conversation history for Claude\n\nHOW IT WORKS NOW:\n1. User books call with John at 10:30 AM\n2. ERA marks state as ''completed'' but keeps all details\n3. User asks \"can you give me a call script?\"\n4. ERA sees calendar context: [Calendar Context: Just booked call with John at 10:30 AM]\n5. ERA can answer intelligently without asking for details again\n\nBENEFITS:\nâœ… ERA remembers what it just did\nâœ… No more asking for info it already has\nâœ… Smoother conversation flow\nâœ… Better user experience\n\nTESTING:\n- Build successful\n- Ready for deployment\n\nFILES CHANGED:\n- src/services/conversation-state.ts (added ''completed'' step and bookedTime field)\n- src/bot/handlers/calendar-handler.ts (mark completed instead of clear)\n- src/bot/app.ts (inject calendar context into conversation history)\n\nVersion: 3.2.7\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
