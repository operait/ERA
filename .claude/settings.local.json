ACTIVE vs HYPOTHETICAL detection (v3.1.3 fix)\n2. Sequential Action Workflow (v3.1.2 fix)\n3. Conversation context recognition\n\nFiles Added:\n- src/templates/__tests__/clarification-protocol.test.ts (13 passing tests)\n- jest.config.js (Jest configuration)\n- TEST_CLARIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md (Manual test documentation)\n\nTest Coverage:\n\n1. ACTIVE vs HYPOTHETICAL Detection (5 tests)\n   âœ“ \"my employee\" triggers clarification\n   âœ“ \"My employee\" (capitalized) triggers clarification\n   âœ“ \"our team member\" triggers clarification\n   âœ“ Employee name triggers clarification\n   âœ“ CRITICAL: \"What should I do if MY employee...\" is ACTIVE (v3.1.3 fix)\n\n2. HYPOTHETICAL Situations (2 tests)\n   âœ“ \"an employee\" provides full guidance\n   âœ“ \"someone\" provides full guidance\n\n3. Sequential Action Workflow (3 tests)\n   âœ“ Offers calendar booking, NOT email drafting\n   âœ“ Does NOT offer both call AND email simultaneously\n   âœ“ After call outcome, THEN offers email drafting\n\n4. Conversation Context (1 test)\n   âœ“ Recognizes when user is answering ERA''s question\n\n5. MASTER_PROMPT.md Integration (2 tests)\n   âœ“ Loads MASTER_PROMPT.md successfully\n   âœ“ System prompt includes ACTIVE/HYPOTHETICAL detection rules\n\nTest Results: 13/13 passing\n\nHow to Run:\n```bash\nnpm test -- clarification-protocol.test.ts\nnpm test -- --watch  # Watch mode\nnpm test -- --coverage  # With coverage report\n```\n\nBenefits:\n- Automated regression prevention\n- Catches issues before manual testing\n- Validates MASTER_PROMPT.md changes\n- CI/CD integration ready\n- Fast feedback loop (< 5 seconds)\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
      "Bash(git commit -m \"$(cat <<''EOF''\nAdd /test slash command to run automated tests\n\nCreated a convenient /test slash command to quickly run the clarification\nprotocol tests before making changes or deploying.\n\nFile Added:\n- .claude/commands/test.md\n\nUsage:\n  /test\n\nThis will:\n1. Run all 13 clarification protocol tests\n2. Show which tests passed/failed\n3. Provide deployment recommendation\n\nExpected Output: All 13 tests should pass âœ“\n\nBenefits:\n- Quick verification before committing changes\n- Catch regressions before manual testing\n- Easy to run from Claude Code interface\n- No need to remember the full npm test command\n\nExample workflow:\n1. Make changes to MASTER_PROMPT.md\n2. Run /test to verify no regressions\n3. If all tests pass, deploy with confidence\n4. If tests fail, fix issues before deploying\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
