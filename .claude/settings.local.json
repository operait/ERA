Go to Outlook Settings\n2. Calendar â†’ Time zones\n3. Set to their actual timezone (e.g., America/New_York)\n\nBut this fix ensures ERA works correctly even if they haven''t.\n\nTESTING:\n- All calendar tests still pass (10/11)\n- 1 pre-existing test failure unrelated to this fix\n\nFILES CHANGED:\n- src/bot/handlers/calendar-handler.ts (timezone detection logic)\n\nVersion: 3.2.2\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",

Test Pacific timezone handling\n   - Ensures timezone handling works for other US timezones\n   - Verifies 9 AM Pacific (16:00 UTC) is parsed correctly\n\nCOVERAGE:\n- All 3 new tests pass\n- Total: 13/14 tests passing (1 pre-existing failure unrelated)\n- These tests will catch any future regression of the UTC timezone bug\n\nFILES CHANGED:\n- src/services/__tests__/calendar.test.ts (3 new regression tests)\n\nVersion: 3.2.3\")",
