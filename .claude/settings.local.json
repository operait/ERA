      "Bash(git commit -m \"$(cat <<''EOF''\nAdd Sequential Action Workflow to MASTER_PROMPT.md v3.1.2\n\nCRITICAL FIX: ERA now focuses on ONE action at a time (call first, then wait for outcome)\n\nProblem:\n- ERA was recommending calling the employee AND offering to draft emails simultaneously\n- Created confusion about which action to take first\n- Manager needs sequential guidance, not multiple parallel options\n- Call outcome determines if email is even needed\n\nChanges to MASTER_PROMPT.md v3.1.2:\n\n1. Added \"Sequential Action Workflow\" section (lines 104-133)\n   - Focus on call first, help schedule it, then STOP\n   - DO NOT offer email drafting when recommending a call\n   - Wait for manager to complete call and report back\n   - THEN decide if email needed based on call outcome\n\n2. Updated Response Guidelines (lines 135-151)\n   - If next step is calling: offer calendar booking and STOP\n   - If next step is NOT calling: offer email drafting/templates\n   - Clear separation of when to offer different actions\n\n3. Added example showing correct sequential flow:\n   - Manager answers clarifying questions\n   - ERA recommends call and offers calendar booking (stops here)\n   - Manager completes call and reports back\n   - ERA then offers email drafting based on outcome\n\nWorkflow Priority:\n1. Ask clarifying questions first\n2. Recommend the immediate next action (e.g., call)\n3. Help execute that action (e.g., schedule call)\n4. STOP and wait for outcome\n5. Based on outcome, recommend next action (e.g., email to HR)\n\nThis ensures managers get focused, step-by-step guidance without confusion.\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
