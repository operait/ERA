# ðŸš€ Push to GitHub - Safe Commands

Your repository is ready and your secrets are protected!

## âœ… Security Check Complete
- `.env` with API keys is NOT being tracked âœ“
- `.env.example` (template) IS being tracked âœ“
- All source code ready to push âœ“

## Run These Commands:

```bash
# 1. Commit all files
git commit -m "Initial ERA MVP commit - HR Assistant Bot for Teams"

# 2. Set main branch
git branch -M main

# 3. Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/operait/ERA.git

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Or Run All at Once:
```bash
git commit -m "Initial ERA MVP commit - HR Assistant Bot for Teams" && git branch -M main && git remote add origin https://github.com/operait/ERA.git && git push -u origin main
```

## After Pushing:

1. âœ… Go to https://github.com/operait/ERA to verify
2. âœ… Check that `.env` is NOT in the repository
3. âœ… Connect Render to this GitHub repo
4. âœ… Add environment variables in Render dashboard

## Important Reminders:
- Never commit changes to `.env` file
- Always use Render's environment variables for production
- Keep API keys secure and rotate them regularly
