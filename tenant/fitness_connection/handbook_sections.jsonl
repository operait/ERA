Fitness\nConnection may also require recertification at certain intervals, including if the Teammate seeks extend the leave of\nabsence beyond what has bee n certified.\nSubstitution of Paid Leave\nTeammates must substitute any available PTO for any part of unpaid FMLA leave provided under this policy.\nHowever, if you are currently receiving short -term disability or workers' compensation benefits, you will not be\nrequired to use accrued PTO during the period in which you are receiving benefits. Once PTO has been exhausted,\nany remaining FMLA leave will be unpaid.\nFMLA leave runs concurrently with any other applicable paid or unpaid leave. Using available PTO, short -term\ndisability, or workers' compensation benefits will not extend your total leave time beyond the maximum of 12 weeks\nallowed under the FMLA.\nIntermittent FMLA Leave\nIntermittent FMLA leave is leave taken in increments due to an illness or injury, rather than in one continuous period\nof time. This may include FMLA leave taken on a reduced leave schedule, which means a leave schedule that reduces\nthe hours a Teammate wo rks in a workweek or workday.\nTo qualify for intermittent leave, the need must be medically necessary due to a serious health condition. Intermittent\nleave may be used to attend appointments with a healthcare provider for necessary treatment of the Teammate’s\nown serious health conditi on or that of a qualifying family member. Intermittent leave may also be used for\nqualifying exigencies.\nWhen using this type of leave, Teammates must attempt to schedule their leave so as not to disrupt normal business\noperations.\nBenefits while on FMLA Leave\nDuring an approved FMLA leave, Fitness Connection will maintain your health and other benefits, as if you continued\nto be actively employed. However, Teammates will be required to pay their portion of insurance premiums during\nthe leave. (If you are substi tuting accrued PTO for the unpaid FMLA leave, your share of premiums will be paid by\nthe method normally used during any paid leave – i.e., a payroll deduction.) If you return to work owing any\ncontributions for your portion of insurance premiums that the Company made to maintain coverage during your\nleave, you will be required to catch up on your premiums payments through payroll deduction(s).\nPTO will not accrue during FMLA leave.\nReinstatement\nAt the beginning of FMLA leave, the Teammate must inform Fitness Connection of their expected return date. Upon\nreturn from FMLA leave, the Teammate will be reinstated to either their former position or an equivalent position\nwith equivalent pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment.\nUse of FMLA leave will not result in the loss of any employment benefit that a Teammate earned or was entitled to\nbefore using FMLA leave. In addition, FMLA leave will not be counted against a Teammate for purposes of the\nCompany’s attendance and punctuali ty policies.\nIf a Teammate has taken FMLA leave for their own serious health condition, Fitness Connection requires that, upon\nreturn from leave, the Teammate present a fitness -for-duty medical certification, signed by the Teammate’s\nhealthcare provider, clearing the T eammate to return to work and perform all essential functions.
