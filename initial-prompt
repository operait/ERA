I'm building Era, an HR assistant for Fitness Connection. She integrates into their Microsoft Teams to answer questions from managers. I need to start with the absolute minimum viable database schema in Supabase to store their HR policy documents and enable semantic search.

Current context:
- I have Fitness Connection's policy data in JSONL files (incident escalation matrix, corrective action templates, voluntary termination workflows, etc.)
- I need to ingest this data and make it searchable via pgvector
- The bot will run in Teams and answer manager questions

Create the minimal Supabase schema I need:
1. Core tables for documents and embeddings
2. Basic RLS policies for tenant isolation
3. A simple vector search function

Make it production-simple, not enterprise-complex. I'm solo and have 1 week.

Build out a Todo list and document for Era
